# Flanker-TaskSwitching
Make sure to edit file paths in config file. 
The easiest way to make this work is to have a folder that contains both the flanker folder and the task switching folder in it.

Additionally, you can change what columns to get in get_columns for both the flanker and the task switching files.
Make sure that the column names match the columns names in the original file.
